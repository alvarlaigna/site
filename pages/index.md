## SurviveJS - React

<p>
<img src="assets/img/react.png" alt="React" class="react-image" width="200" height="200" />
Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) powers an increasing amount of sites. There is a good reason for this. It simplifies frontend development greatly.
</p>

Combined with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), a bundling tool, you have a powerful frontend development environment in your hands. The SurviveJS effort consists of two books that help you to adopt these technologies. They are available as [a bundle](https://leanpub.com/b/survivejs-webpack-react).

  **SurviveJS - React** shows you how to build a simple [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29). The idea is that if you can build a simple application, you can probably build something more complex after that. The first application is always the hardest.
</p>

In addition to fundamental React knowledge, you will pick up design techniques as you develop the application step by step and learn to understand it in detail.

## The Kanban Project

Once you have completed the project, you will end up with something like this:

<p>

</p>

Even though the application looks simple, it's complex enough to illustrate potential problems such as reference handling.

<blockquote class="tip">
Psst. <a href="/demos/implementing-kanban/drag-and-drop" target="_blank">You can try out the application online.</a>
</blockquote>

The book is based on a [boilerplate](https://github.com/survivejs/react-boilerplate). If you want to understand the techniques used in the boilerplate itself, check out the webpack book (scroll down to learn more). This book is all about React.

While implementing the Kanban step by step, you will pick up basic ideas of how to compose your application, how to manage data related concerns, how to style your application, how to implement drag and drop. Those are just few topics of the many covered.

Even if you know React well already, there might be handy ideas to pick up. The book effort started early 2015 and has seen steady releases since. Each release has improved the book somehow as the React ecosystem keeps on changing.

### SurviveJS is Community Driven

SurviveJS is a community driven effort. There's a [free edition](/react/introduction) that contains most of the content. You can also [check out the project at GitHub](https://github.com/survivejs/react). GitHub contains the associated source and a way for you to send feedback. I am also available through [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/survivejs/react) if you have more direct questions.

### Getting the Book

Even though SurviveJS is community driven, the effort still needs to be funded somehow. This is the reason why Leanpub buyers get access to exclusive content. Currently this means bonus chapters on typing and testing. The Leanpub version comes in pdf, epub, and mobi formats (no DRM).

The income goes back to pushing the effort further. The goal here is not to make the maximum amount of money. It's about giving back to the community given the community enables all this. And as you enable the effort, you get more material. Fair deal!

You can support creation of new content by [purchasing a digital copy of the book](https://leanpub.com/survivejs-react). If you want something more personal ([training](https://survivejs.github.io/training/), consulting), contact me personally and I'll see what I can do.

### What are the prerequisites?

I expect you know the basics of JavaScript and Node.js. Some experience in ES6 won't hurt. Plenty of patience is needed as there's a lot to learn.

## SurviveJS - Webpack

<p>
  <img class='front-cover' src='assets/img/webpack_title_page_small.png' width='255' height='329' />

  Originally **SurviveJS - Webpack** was a part of the original book. Eventually I realized [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), the bundling tool, deserves a book of its own. This is that book.
</p>

Just like the first book, this has evolved organically as well. The early part of the book explains why Webpack is needed, shows you how to develop Webpack configuration of your own step by step, and then moves onto more advanced topics.

I chose an approach that allows me to discuss one technique at a time. This makes the book handy for reference.

The book covers actually more than just Webpack. You will learn also about the surrounding ecosystem. This means you will learn to improve the quality of your code using tools such as [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). There are also React specific tips given this book originates from the first one.

### Getting the Book

Just like the React one, there's a [free edition](/webpack/introduction) available. You can support the effort by [purchasing a digital copy of the book](https://leanpub.com/survivejs-webpack). About a third of the income goes to Tobias Koppers, the author of Webpack. This is my way of saying thanks and supporting his effort.

There's also a [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/survivejs/webpack). You can [check out the project at GitHub](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack) as well.

### What are the prerequisites?

I expect you know Node.js and JavaScript on a basic level. The book doesn't use ES6 features in any notable manner. Webpack is complex enough without so it's better to keep this simple.
