It’s a funny story how I started with webpack. Before getting addicted to JavaScript, I also developed in Java. I tried GWT (Google Web Toolkit) in that time. GWT is a Java-to-JavaScript Compiler, which has a great feature: code splitting. I liked this feature and missed it in existing JavaScript T…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/preface">Preface</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
The book you are reading right now goes years back. It all started from a comment I made at Christian Alfoni’s blog in 2014. I had recently discovered webpack and React, and I felt there was a need for a cookbook about the topics. We started writing it as a GitHub wiki early 2015.

Webpack simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem: bundling.

Webpack is a module bundler. You can use it with task runners while leaving bundling to it. The line has become blurred, though, as the community has developed many plugins for it.
