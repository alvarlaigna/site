It’s a funny story how I started with webpack. Before getting addicted to JavaScript, I also developed in Java. I tried GWT (Google Web Toolkit) in that time. GWT is a Java-to-JavaScript Compiler, which has a great feature: code splitting.

Webpack simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem: bundling.
