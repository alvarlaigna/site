Webpack simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem: bundling. It takes in various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and then transforms these assets into a format that&#x27;s easy to consume through a browser. Doing this well takes away significant amount of pain from web devel…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/webpack-compared">Webpack Compared</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
You can understand better why webpack&#x27;s approach is powerful by putting it into a historical context. Back in the day, it was enough just to concatenate some scripts together. Times have changed, though, and now distributing your JavaScript code can be a complex endeavor.

This problem has escalate…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/why-webpack">Why Webpack?</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Why would you use webpack over tools like Gulp or Grunt? It&#x27;s not an either-or proposition. Webpack deals with the difficult problem of bundling, but there&#x27;s so much more. I picked up webpack because of its support for Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

You can use webpack with task runners and let it …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack">Developing with Webpack</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Webpack is driven by configuration, normally named as webpack.config.js. That&#x27;s the heart of it all. The configuration defines the inputs and the outputs of your project.

Tools, such as LiveReload or BrowserSync, allow us to refresh the browser as we develop our application and avoid refresh for CSS changes. It is possible to setup Browsersync to work with webpack through browser-sync-webpack-plugin, but webpack has more tricks in store.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) builds on top the WDS. It enables an interface that makes it possible to swap modules live. For example, style-loader can update your CSS without forcing a refresh. It is easy to perform HMR with CSS, as it doesn&#x27;t contain any application state.

Even though we haven&#x27;t done a lot with webpack yet, the amount of configuration is starting to feel substantial.

Webpack doesn&#x27;t handle styling out of the box. Instead, you must configure loaders and plugins to get the setup you need.

Even though we have a nice build set up now, where did all the CSS go? As per our configuration, it has been inlined to JavaScript! Even though this can be convenient during development, it doesn&#x27;t sound ideal.

Frameworks like Bootstrap tend to come with a lot of CSS. Often you use only a small part of it. Normally, you just bundle even the unused CSS. It is possible, however, to eliminate the portions you aren&#x27;t using.

Loading fonts is a surprisingly tough problem. There are typically four font formats to worry about, each for a certain browser.
