Webpack simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem - the problem of bundling. It takes in various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and then transforms these assets into a format that&#x27;s easy to consume through a browser. By doing this well, it takes away significant amount…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/webpack-compared">Webpack Compared</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
You can understand better why Webpack&#x27;s approach is powerful by putting it into a historical context. Back in the day, it was enough just to concatenate some scripts together. Times have changed, though, and now distributing your JavaScript code can be a complex endeavor.

This problem has escalate…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack">Developing with Webpack</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Webpack is driven by configuration, normally named as webpack.config.js. That&#x27;s the heart of it all. The configuration defines the inputs and the outputs of your project. Most importantly, it describes the types of transformations you perform. These transformations are defined using loaders and plu…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack/getting-started">Getting Started</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Make sure you are using a recent version of Node.js installed. I recommend using at least the most recent LTS (Long-Term Support) version. Before going further, you should have node and npm commands available at your terminal.

The completed configuration is available at GitHub. If you are unsure o…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack/splitting-configuration">Splitting the Configuration</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
At minimum, your Webpack configuration can be contained in a single file. As the needs of your project grow, you&#x27;ll need to figure out means to manage it. It becomes necessary to split it up per environment so that you have enough control over the build result. There is no single right way to achie…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack/automatic-browser-refresh">Automatic Browser Refresh</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Tools, such as LiveReload or Browsersync, allow us to refresh the browser as we develop our application. They can even avoid refresh for CSS changes.

A good first step towards a better development environment would be to use Webpack in its watch mode. You can activate it through webpack --watch. O…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack/refreshing-css">Refreshing CSS</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
In this chapter we&#x27;ll set up CSS with our project and see how it works out with automatic browser refreshing. The neat thing is that in this case Webpack doesn&#x27;t have to force a full refresh. Instead, it can do something smarter as we&#x27;ll see soon.

To improve the debuggability of the application, we can set up sourcemaps for both code and styling. Sourcemaps allow you to see exactly where an error was raised. Webpack can generate both inline sourcemaps included within bundles or separate sourcemap files. The former is useful during developme…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/building-with-webpack">Building with Webpack</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">

So far we haven&#x27;t given thought to our build output and no doubt it&#x27;s going to be a little chunky, especially as we include React in it. We can apply a variety of techniques to bring down the size of it. We can also leverage client level caching and load certain assets lazily.

React relies on process.env.NODE_ENV based optimizations. If we force it to production, React will get built in an optimized manner. This will disable some checks (e.g., property type checks). Most importantly it will give you a smaller build and improved performance.

Currently the production version of our application is a single JavaScript file. This isn&#x27;t ideal. If we change the application, the client has to download vendor dependencies as well.

Webpack relies on the concept of placeholders. These strings are used to attach specific information to Webpack output. The most useful ones are:

[path] - Returns an entry path.

Our current setup doesn&#x27;t clean the build directory between builds. As this can get annoying if we change our setup, we can use a plugin to clean the directory for us.

Frameworks like Bootstrap tend to come with a lot of CSS. Often you use only a small part of it. Normally you just bundle even the unused CSS.

This part discusses how to load various common assets, such as styling files, images, and fonts, using Webpack.

Webpack supports a large variety of formats through loaders. In addition, it supports a couple of JavaScript module formats out of the box. Generally, the idea is always the same.

Loading styles is a standard operation. There are a lot of variants depending on the styling approach you use, though. I&#x27;ll cover the most common options next. You can combine these approaches with the ExtractTextPlugin to get better output for your production build.

The easiest way to make your application slow is to load a lot of small assets. Each request comes with an overhead after all.

Loading fonts is a surprisingly tough problem. There are typically four(!) font formats to worry about, each for certain browser. Inlining all formats at once wouldn&#x27;t be a particularly good idea. There are a couple of strategies we can consider.
