## SurviveJS - Clinic

A clinic is a miniature version of my [workshops](/workshop/). Maybe you have specific problems in mind and want specific feedback on those. The exact content is customized per client and we can spend time with your code in addition to general topics.

Two hours is a good amount of time for a clinic and it will give you a high energy blast of ideas and potential solutions to problems related to either webpack or React.

## How Much Does This Cost?

A clinic comes with fixed prices as below:

* 2h session for a company - min. 400 euros (VAT 0)
* 2h session for an individual - The price for individuals is split between participants. If there are four, then each would pay min. 100 euros (VAT 24). The amount of individuals per session is capped to four.

If you want me on-site, you'll have to pay for related travel costs.

The prices have been given as minimums. If you feel you get more value out of a session, compensate accordingly.
